                    ******** ALGLOW ********
Alglow, a skin care company that works to make skin-care products more healthier 😀 and better for the environment. 🌸
This company uses marine algae grown in a lab to make skin care products, like sunscreens, moisturizers, etc. 🧴
👩‍🔬 Our work will have scientific backups from professionals, like dermatologist 👩‍⚕️ , and approved by the FDA. 👍
🧴 Most of the sunscreens that we all used these days, are mainly produced from chemical compounds that can leave white casts on skin. 
🍃 Not only that, but we could also release them into the ecosystem to harm life on earth 🌎, like when we're using them in white, sandy beaches 🏝 on a bright, sunny day. ☀️
🪸 Coral reefs can even be affected by the chemical ingredients in most of the sunscreens used these days. 🐠
But Alglow will make them better with mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) that will make skin care products 🧴 more organic, more healthier, and less harmful.
