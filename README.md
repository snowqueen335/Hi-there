# Hi-there
👩‍🔬 Hi, I'm Jaclyn Truong. I'm currently a student from UNC Charlotte, dual majoring in biology 🧪 and computer science 👩‍💻 that concentrates on bioinformatics. 
📖 After graduation, I'm getting a job in the healthcare industry. 👩‍🎓
Could be pharmacy technician or lab technician 🧫. Anything related to medicine. 💊
💉 I want to learn everything I need about the medical field 👩‍⚕️, even the business side of medicine, like pharmacy/pharmaceutical sales. 👩‍💼
I speak English, Vietnamese and a little bit of Spanish. Although, my Spanish could still be a little better with some online help and practice since it's been a while since I had Spanish class. 👩‍🏫
For my BINF 4900 class, I work with my partner, Saipriya, on a company that we both created for our presentation, Alglow. 💄
💋 Alglow is basically a skin care company that strive to make skin care products more organic and better for both the skin and the environment. ☘️
